Hello! My name is Przemysław Piotrowski. I'm from Poland, more particularly a small city close to [Toruń](https://goo.gl/maps/tUaYi3cYLPm).
I have commercial experience in web development for about 4 years, although I've been programming on-and-off since primary school through high-school
and university.

I identify myself as a backend developer. I code mostly in Ruby on Rails, but lately I've been doing projects in **React** and **Vue**. I love tinkering
around with DevOps-related tools, like **Ansible**, **Docker**, **AWS** stack and so on. I believe in a business-first approach of developing software
(as Linus Torvalds said: "without users, your program is not a program, it's a pointless piece of code that you might as well throw away") and
I believe that following **DevOps** principles and **Agile** methodology is a good way to achieve that.

Jordan Peterson's first rule from his book 12 Rules for life is "Clean up your room!" - as a programmer I paraphrase that and declare
"Clean up your code!", because who wants to read methods consisting of 150 lines? Btw in the topic of bad patterns... did you know
that MVC pattern is over [40 years old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller#History)?

In my free time I sing and I play guitar (maybe one day I'll have some links to show :) ), I read philosophy books, train powerlifting at the
gym, follow healthy habits and read about dieting (I'm a fan of low-to-moderate carb diets, I did ketogenic diet and a bit of fasting too).

Ping me any time on facebook, email, wherever you can find me. I'll gladly discuss any subject!

Have a good day!
