> Are you willing to put additional effort into tackling the challenges that arise when employing remote workers?

Recently I gave a talk on remote work at [DTech 2018](https://setskillbuild.com/dtech2018/), a technology event that took place in Vila Real, Portugal.
Working in a [company](https://polcode.com/) for which remote work is bread and butter, and being a full-remote worker myself,
I wanted to give my input on why would you want to work remotely, why remote work is a **good idea** in general, when it **doesn't function properly**,
and how to *organize your company to make distributed teams efficient*.

This is part two of my "On working remotely" post, where I will talk about what are the things to look out for when organizing distributed teams
in **your** company. I will share with you some studies done about remote work and tips on how to manage remote and on-site workers in your
company and we'll discuss some things that we have to look out for.

## Working remote

First, let me give you an example of working remote...

... :)

I hope you enjoyed my *remote pun*. Now, jokes aside, you're probably wondering what's the answer to the question I posed in the title.

## What do the studies say?

The most reasonable thing to do first, when trying to answer the question "should I employ remotely", is to consider what are the facts. There are
studies done about remote work, so let's have a look at them. There are a bunch of them available online, but I'm going to reference three in this post:

* _**[OwlLabs - State of Remote Work 2017](https://www.owllabs.com/state-of-remote-work-2017)**_
* _**[OwlLabs - State of Remote Work 2018](https://www.owllabs.com/state-of-remote-work)**_
* _**[TINYpulse - What Leaders Need To Know About Remote Workers](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/443262/pdf/TINYpulse_What_Leaders_Need_to_Know_About_Remote_Workers.pdf)**_

First, let me talk a little bit about the first one from 2017. It's a study done on around *1000 US-based* responders across companies of all sizes
and industries. Give it a quick glance to have context for my commentary below.

#### OwlLabs - State of Remote Work 2017

Working remotely is **not** that new thing, as 52% of responders work remotely at least once a week. Sales hire *66% more* workers remotely
than average. For IT the percentage of people hired remotely is *around 12%*.

Unexpectedly to me, fully distributed companies **hire 33% faster** than other companies. Personally, I think it's due to the fact that distributed
companies need to be more modern in order to manage remote as well as on-site workers, which translates into an improvement in other areas as well.
So it's more of a *correlation* than *cause-and-effect*. Also, companies that allow remote work offer more flexibility to their workers and are more
*attractive* and *competitive*, which is why they have **25% lower employee turnover** than companies who don't!

There are downsides to remote working, unfortunately, and we need to talk about these as well. Due to the nature of full-remote work, it's
natural that employees don't spend as much time communicating with their colleagues, which is why the study show's that employees **miss office
conversations**. Besides, a **lot** of information in the company is shared in the form of office chit-chat, and when you're a remote worker, obviously,
you miss a big chunk of that. All these things are the reason for the fact that it's *more difficult* for remote workers to **contribute to the company
culture** and feel like a part of the company.

It looks like there is a big demand for remote work as **65% of employees would like to work remotely at least once a month**. This shows that remote work
is something that workers *want* and *expect* from their employers. If you want your company to distinguish itself on the market (or maybe due to the
number of companies already having remote work on their menu should I say *to not lag behind*) then remote work is a **must-have**. After all, you
want your company to *keep being competitive* on the job market.

Good news is that managers rate the **performance** of remote workers equally good as the on-site ones. In my
[previous post](https://developer-happiness-blog.com/organization/2018/10/22/on-working-remotely-part-1.html), I pointed out that for most of us remote
workers it feels like we can be much more productive when working from home due to the **lack of distractions**.

#### OwlLabs - State of Remote Work 2018

The study by the same company from 2018 is different from the 2017 one in the sense that this time the respondents represented employees from
*all continents* (except Antarctica) and that the results were grouped based on that geographical data. Thanks to that we can see that there are
no *big* differences in terms of remote work trends across the globe, with **South America** standing out with having **81% more fully-remote companies**
than the global average and **67% higher possibility of an employee being full-remote**.

Apart from that, the new things we can learn from this study are the facts that:
* those who work remote at **least once a month** are **24% more likely to feel happy and productive** in their roles than those who **don't or can't work remotely**.
* the #1 reason that people choose remote work in 2018 is **productivity & focus**.

Take a closer look at this study if you want to know more details about geographical differences in terms of remote work.

#### TINYpulse - What Leaders Need To Know About Remote Workers

Lastly, we're going to look at data from the **TinyPulse study**:

<img src="/img/posts/on-working-remotely/tinypulse.png" alt="tinypulse screen" class="post-image">

The results are clear - remote workers feel **happier** and **more valued** at work. Unfortunately, they rate their **relationship with coworkers**
*worse* than the average respondent, but that's expected due to the communication issues we pointed out before.

Amazingly, TINYpulse found out that **91% of respondents say they’re more productive when working remotely**!

So! I think that in general, the studies are pretty **optimistic**!

From what we have seen I can think of *3 issues* that a company hiring remote workers must face and that is:
1. **Communication**
1. **Organization of work**
1. **Cultivating company culture**

I want to talk a bit about how we could tackle these issues and I'm going to use the company I work for (that is [Polcode](www.polcode.com))
as an example.

## Communication

### Use proper software
First, you need to have **software** that allows you to communicate *freely* and *efficiently*. Ideally, this should be software that allows you to do
unlimited **video conferencing** with a large number of people at the same time. Engagement of remote participants of a meeting is much better if everyone
can freely speak with each other. *Seeing* each other would be perfect because it allows conversing also on a *non-verbal level* through body
language. For communication, you can use Slack, Rocketchat, Zoom, Skype, Google hangouts or many others.

### Encourage informal communication
At Polcode we believe that
> (...) making friends on private grounds will also increase openness in business matters. - Małgorzata Pająk, Polcode Board Member

So, we do everything we can to not only **encourage communication** within the teams and the whole company but also to encourage **informal communication**.
We have a closed Facebook group, where *everyone* is able to talk freely and post *whatever they want*. We use Rocketchat where everyone is
free to create their own *off-topic channels*. We have no moderation anywhere, we encourage jokes (even though most of them are not funny),
we have **free speech** all the way. Indeed, having a **friendly** and **relaxed** atmosphere makes it easier to work with each other in business.

## Organization

It's necessary to have your **onboarding** process properly set up. The goal here is to make your workers *feel like a part of the company*
**as soon as possible** and also to make them *productive* **as soon as possible**. Have a step-by-step list of things every employee has to do when joining
the company and assign a person who will be responsible for making sure that this person is executing this list.

Next, use **software**, which will guarantee that a team consisting of remote as well as on-site workers will be able to seamlessly deliver a project.
* Git repository management - Github, Gitlab, BitBucket ...
* Project management tools - JIRA, Trello, Pivotal, Redmine ...
* etc.

## Cultivating company culture

If you want employees to be engaged you need to make them *feel like a part of the company*. In Polcode we put a lot of effort into this, for example,
by organizing a bunch of events that both remote and on-site workers can attend.

We organize annual **company retreats** which take a couple of days. We do quarterly **workshops**. We meet monthly in offices for **integration parties**. We send
out **welcome packages** to new employees. We have a Facebook group, off-topic channels on RocketChat. Each month we have an internal newsletter, which
includes some of the exciting things that are happening in the company. All this makes us feel **more integrated**.

## Should I employ remotely?

Now to the **main point**!

*Are you willing to put additional effort into tackling the challenges that arise when employing remote workers?*

If yes, then definitely it's you **should** employ remote workers. Besides having a bigger pool of employees to choose from (not just your city and
surroundings, but theoretically the *whole world*) there are another bunch of advantages described above, like the possibility of having **smaller
employee turnover** or **better employee satisfaction and performance**. Just remember to handle **communication** properly and take care of your remote
workers a little bit more than your on-site workers.

## Summary

Thanks for reading and please share your experiences with remote work in the comments below! I will be glad to hear your opinion on this
subject!
