First of all, it's an awesome game and it's **free**!

# Bad effects of video games?

Fortunately, fewer and fewer people think bad of video games thanks to awesome studies being done, like the one that shows no correlation between
crime and playing violent video games [1]. In the last years, the evidence for **positive effects** of playing video game stacks up. Turns out healthy
video games playing (without becoming addicted of course which is possible) is *very* good for you.

# Cognitive benefits

Video games need to set a task that's **difficult** to complete, so that the player can **learn** and master it, thus giving him a sense of *pride*
and *accomplishment*. This mechanism motivates the player to get better at the game overcoming harder and harder challenges it presents until the game
is fully beaten.

There is an **awesome** number of positive effects of playing video games. Here is the list with sources:
* **Improved visual contrast sensitivity** (the ability to distinguish subtle differences in shades of grey) [2]
* **Successful treatment of amblyopia** (lazy eye) [3]
* **Improved spatial attention** - that is improved performance on the ability to locate a target stimulus in a field of distractors - a test which
  has been found to be a good predictor of the ability to drive. [4]
* **Improved ability to track moving objects in a field of distractors** - keeping track of a set of moving objects that were visually identical
  to other moving objects in the visual field [5]
* **Reduced impulsiveness** [6]
* **Overcoming dyslexia** [7]
* **Improved ability to engage in multiple tasks simultaneously** [8]
* **Increased mental flexibility** - abilities to switch rapidly and without error between tasks that have conflicting demands [4] [9] [10]
* **Reversing mental decline that accompanies ageing** [11]

Video games improve **job performance**, especially for jobs that require good *eye-hand coordination, attention, excellent working memory,
and quick decision-making*:
* Video gamers were better than non-gamers in the ability to fly and land aerial drones and were essentially as good as trained pilots on this skill [12]
* Young, inexperienced surgeons who were also video gamers outperformed the most experienced surgeons in their field [13]
* Novice surgeons who were provided with experience with video games improved their performance in laparoscopic surgery compared with a control
  group of surgeons who did not have that experience [14]


# Why Starcraft 2?

Starcraft 2 is a complex *Real-Time Strategy* game which forces the player to master *many game mechanics* in order to successfully overwhelm his opponent.
These include base building, resource gathering, army production and management, scouting and using unit's special abilities. **Thorough knowledge
of the game** is required to utilize all of its mechanics. The player who wins is the one who develops a **better economy**, does more APM (actions per
minute), uses better **strategy** and composes an army with such units that can successfully counter the opposing one. Starcraft 2 is a very
**fast-paced game**, where an average play between 2 players takes around *15 minutes*. The first attack usually happens at around 5-7 minutes mark.

Due to all of this a player needs to **focus** to the **maximum** of his abilities through all the time of the game. He's constantly **multitasking**,
managing his base and his army at the same time, **planning and making decisions** about which units to produce and how to expand his base.
Extreme **agility** when using a mouse is required - pro players make more than 200 APM and a misclick can decide on the outcome of a battle.

By playing Starcraft 2 for just a couple of weeks I can see that these skills *easily* translate to programming. This also agrees with the studies
listed above. I learned to be **focused** and perform at *100% of my abilities for extended periods of time*. I can **switch attention** between
tasks in a more flawless manner. Increased *mouse agility* and ability to use *key shortcuts* raised my **productiveness** and decreased
procrastination. Switching tabs is easier, writing is faster, also I see an increased need to solve the problem **right now**.

# Try it out!

I started playing Starcraft 2 for fun, it was by accident that I found I became a better programmer. If you found out that
it's not the case with you, then in this worst scenario at least you had some fun ;) Not to mention video games are a *great* way to
relieve stress after a full day of work :)
